    <summary>Tool for visualizing scientific literature landscapes</summary>
    <description>VOSviewer is a software tool for constructing and visualizing bibliometric networks. These networks may for instance include journals, researchers, or individual publications, and they can be constructed based on citation, bibliographic coupling, co-citation, or co-authorship relations. VOSviewer also offers text mining functionality that can be used to construct and visualize co-occurrence networks of important terms extracted from a body of scientific literature.

## Highlights
#### Data

* **Web of Science, Scopus, Dimensions, Lens, and PubMed.** Co-authorship networks, citation-based networks, and co-occurrence networks can be created based on data downloaded from Web of Science, Scopus, Dimensions, and Lens. Co-authorship networks and co-occurrence networks can also be created based on PubMed data.
* **Crossref, Europe PMC, and OpenAlex.** Networks can also be created based on data retrieved through the APIs of Crossref, Europe PMC, and OpenAlex. These APIs can be queried interactively in VOSviewer.
* **Semantic Scholar, OpenCitations, and WikiData.** For a given set of DOIs, networks can also be created based on data retrieved through the APIs of Semantic Scholar, OpenCitations, and WikiData.

#### Visualization

* **Zooming and scrolling.** Visualizations of bibliometric networks can be explored in full detail using zoom and scroll functionality similar to for instance Google Maps. A smart labeling algorithm prevents labels from overlapping each other.
* **Density and overlay visualizations.** Density visualizations provide a quick overview of the main areas in a bibliometric network. Overlay visualizations can for instance be used to show developments over time.
* **Screenshots.** Screenshots of bibliometric network visualizations can be created at a high resolution and can be saved in many popular graphical file formats, both bitmap and vector formats.

#### Techniques

* **Advanced layout and clustering techniques.** State-of-the-art techniques for network layout and network clustering are provided. Layout and clustering results can be fine-tuned using various parameters.
* **Natural language processing techniques.** Natural language processing techniques are available for creating term co-occurrence networks based on English-language textual data. Relevant and non-relevant terms can be distinguished algorithmically.
* **Creating bibliometric networks.** A number of advanced features are available for creating bibliometric networks (e.g., co-authorship, bibliographic coupling, and co-citation networks). For instance, the influence of publications with many authors, many citations, or many references can be reduced using a fractional counting approach. Data cleaning can be performed using thesaurus files.

## Dependency note
The VOSviewer package can be installed without a dependency, but it requires a Java Runtime Environment v8+ to start.  Any flavor of Java should work, but the application will not start without the Oracle JavaSoft registry key configured.  Some JRE packages can do this at install.  For example, the [Temurin17jre](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/Temurin17jre) can be installed to work with VOSviewer via `choco install temurin17jre --params="/ADDLOCAL=FeatureOracleJavaSoft"`.  This package will do some basic checks for compatible Java and create the registry key for you in some cases.
