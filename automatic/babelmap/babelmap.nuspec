    <summary>Unicode character map utility</summary>
    <description>BabelMap is a free character map application for Windows that allows you to browse through the entire Unicode character repertoire of nearly 144,000 characters, or search for a particular character by name or by code point. Characters can then be copied to the clipboard for use in any Unicode-aware application. It also provides many useful [features and special utilities](https://www.babelstone.co.uk/Software/BabelMap_Features.html). BabelMap supports the most recent version of the Unicode Standard, currently [Unicode 13.0](http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode13.0.0/) (released March 2020).
