    <summary>A tool for telling interactive, nonlinear stories</summary>
    <description>You don’t need to write any code to create a simple story with Twine, but you can extend your stories with variables, conditional logic, images, CSS, and JavaScript when you're ready.

Twine publishes directly to HTML, so you can post your work nearly anywhere. Anything you create with it is completely free to use any way you like, including for commercial purposes.

### What Is Twine Good At?
* Text-based storytelling. Twine is very text-focused, though you can use images, sound, and video.
* Branching narratives. Twine's user interface is designed to make it easy to visualize the flow through branches of a narrative.
* Web-based publishing. Twine publishes to HTML files which can be uploaded on any web hosting service or shared privately. People can play the things you make without installing any extra software.

Twine has been used to create thousands of works. Find examples on places like [IFDB](https://ifdb.org/search?searchbar=system%3Atwine) or [itch.io](https://itch.io/games/tag-twine).
