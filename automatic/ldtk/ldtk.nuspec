    <summary>A modern, lightweight and efficient 2D level editor.</summary>
    <description>LDtk ("Level Design toolkit") is A modern 2D level editor by game devs with 20+ years of experience creating video games, for game devs.  It could become the backbone of your game dev life. It delivers all the important features in a modern and user-friendly interface.

It is designed with user experience first in mind: do less, but do it right.

## Features
* Easy to use - Every UI details were carefully designed to make the process of creating levels as smooth as possible.
* “Super Simple Export” - For every new tool out there, there is this moment when you need to write the importer for your fav engine. LDtk offers a Super Simple Export option. You will get a few PNGs per levels, a tiny JSON for your entity data and that’s it.
* Auto-rendering - Define some simple rules in a visual editor and let LDtk do the boring part of the skinning job for you.
* Worlds - Choose your world layout among “Grid-vania”, “linear”, or “free” and reorganize all your levels using plain old simple drag-n-drop. Switching between views is also just a mousewheel-roll away.
* Customizable entities - Create your own game entities, with any custom (typed) properties, like “hit points”, a patrol path or an inventory of items.
* Aseprite support - LDtk can load “*.aseprite” files directly, without any whatsoever intermediate PNG conversion. And with live-reloading support, you paint your tiles, save and LDtk updates everything accordingly, including image resizing.
* Platformers &amp; top-downs - LDtk focuses on these perspectives to make sure the user experience feels just right. Sorry, no isometric 3D here!
* Unity, Haxe, Playdate etc. - Load your LDtk project right in your favorite engine and programming language.
* JSON - The app outputs a well documented JSON format that you can easily parse in your favorite game engine.
* Tiled export - Tiled (TMX) optional export to try it out before implementing your own importer.
* Backups - We know bad things can happen. LDtk offers a strong backup system and can even restore unsaved changes if the app crashes (which shouldn’t happen, but hey, we don’t live in a perfect world).
* Pay what you want! - LDtk can be used for free without any limitation. But if you want to support my work, please [consider buying it](https://deepnight.itch.io/ldtk/purchase) or [becoming a direct sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/deepnight).
