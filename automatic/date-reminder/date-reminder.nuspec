    <summary>Reminds you of recurring or nonrecurring events</summary>
    <description>Date Reminder reminds you of recurring or nonrecurring events, like birthdays, bills to pay, appointments etc...
    
The program can be run from the Startup folder with an option to show only, if there are any alerts for this day. If Date Reminder is kept in the System Tray (optional), if will also alert you after standby or hibernation.

The reminders are listed in chronological order, with recurring events showing only once (the next one). This gives you an instant view of the alerts (at top), as well as a full list of all reminders. Other view modes: Alerts only, History.
