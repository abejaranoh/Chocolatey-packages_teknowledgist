## About License

The [RPG Map Editor 2 main site](https://deepnight.net/tools/rpg-map/) and the [Itch.io site](https://deepnight.itch.io/tabletop-rpg-map-editor) include the following statements:

> ### Is it free?

> Yes it is :) RPG Map is "pay what you want, including free".

> You're totally free to try and use it without paying anything, and all the things you create with this tool are, obviously, all yours. At any given time, you can still decide to contribute by paying any price you want for the app.
> is "pay what you want, including free".

> * All commercial uses are permitted: if you create a map using RPG Map II, it's yours. Just remember to credit the app :)

> RPG Map II is completely free to use. **All the content you create with it can be used any way you want, including in commercial products.**

However, that is the extent of the "license", so it cannot, as yet, be redistributed.  At the same time, the only download source is protected from automatic download, so it cannot be downloaded through tools included with Chocolatey.

Thus, this package cannot be uploaded to the [Chocolatey Community Repository](https://community.chocolatey.org), but the code is included in case you want to build a local Chocolatey package.  You just need to download the two zip files and put them in the `tools` directory.
