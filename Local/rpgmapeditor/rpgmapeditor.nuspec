    <summary>Make nice looking RPG maps easily.</summary>
    <description>RPG Map is a tool built to make maps for your tabletop RPG sessions with friends. It’s born from the fact that most existing tools either looked bad or were overly complex to use.
    
The approach is to make an easy to use tool to create beautiful maps quickly.

RPG Map II is completely free to use, but [contributions are welcome](https://deepnight.itch.io/tabletop-rpg-map-editor/purchase). All the content you create with it can be used any way you want, including in commercial products.  Just remember to credit the app :)
