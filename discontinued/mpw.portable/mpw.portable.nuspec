    <summary>A stateless password management solution.</summary>
    <description>Master Password is a completely new way of thinking about passwords.

It consists of an algorithm that implements the core idea and applications for various platforms making the alogirthm available to users on a variety of devices and platforms.

#### Benefits of using Master Password:

* You don't need to think up a new strong password every time you make a new account - Master Password gives you the key for it.
* You don't need to try remembering a password you created two years ago for that one account - Master Password gives you the key for it.
* You don't need to try to keep password lists in sync or stored somewhere easily accessible - Master Password keys can be created anywhere.
* You don't need to trust that a service will be online and stay online - Master Password is availale everywhere, even offline.
* If you feel at risk of your device being stolen or confiscated, you can set a fake master password, delete my user or wipe it worry-free.
* You don't need to worry about your password manager website getting hacked, your phone getting duplicated, somebody taking a picture of your passwords book - Master Password stores no secrets.

Master Password users have no more passwords. They have a password. Their password is their single master key for unlocking all doors.

The details of how Master Password works [are available here](https://masterpassword.app/masterpassword-algorithm.pdf).

#### One, two, enter.

There are about three steps to using Master Password:

1. Enter your master password.
2. Enter the name of the site.
3. View or copy/paste the generated (not stored!) password.

# Master Password is no longer actively maintained.

Master Password is announcing a massive rewrite, modernizing the solution and clearing the way for exciting new capabilities.

The project is re-launching as [Spectre](https://spectre.app/), still fully open-source Free Software

All development effort has moved to the [Spectre project](https://gitlab.com/spectre.app) and does not currently have a Windows desktop option.
